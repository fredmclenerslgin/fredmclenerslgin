1. Add up your payday loan balances

Your first step in consolidating payday loans is to add up your current balances for all payday loan debt. Loan amounts for personal loans vary, but typically start around $1,000, so youâ€™ll need at least $1,000 in payday debt to apply.
2. Shop around for the best loan

Once you know the amount you need to pay off your debts, shop around and compare loan options from different lenders.

Personal loans are offered at credit unions, online lenders and some banks. Credit unions and online lenders may look more favorably upon applicants with short or no credit history or bad credit scores (629 credit score or lower).
